        <h2>🔥 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To bring <span class="highlight">offline-capable AI tutors</span> to every student with just 2–4 GB RAM, regardless of geography, privilege, or language.</p>
        <p>Built by <strong>Ankit Yadav</strong> — IIT Roorkee alumnus, immigrant, rebel, and founder of the RaaOne revolution.</p>

        <h2>📜 The Origin Myth</h2>
        <p>When Eklavya was denied his right to knowledge, he carved his own path. When Ravana was demonized, he mastered the Vedas and dared to question the gods.</p>
        <blockquote>“They took away his potential. But Eklavya kept his talent.”</blockquote>
        <p>This is not just folklore. This is the spirit of RaaOne.ai — agentic, ethical, local-first AI for those cast aside by the gatekeepers of academia and Silicon Valley.</p>
